# Imperial College Third Year Problem Solving

Welcome to the 3rd year physics problem solving course. The aim of the course is to perform a simplified version of a real High Energy Physics analysis carried out by members of the LHCb collaboration here at Imperial.

## The LHCb collaboration

The [LHCb collaboration](http://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/) is formed of approximately 1000 physicists from institutes all over the world, including a strong presence [here at Imperial](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/high-energy-physics/research/experiments/lhcb/). Together they contribute to the successful running of the LHCb detector and analyses the vast quantities of data it produces. The LHCb experiment is one of the 4 large experiments at the LHC particle collider operating at CERN, near Geneva.
