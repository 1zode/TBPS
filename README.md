# Imperial College Third Year Problem Solving

Welcome to the 3rd year physics problem solving course. The aim of the course is to perform a simplified version of a real High Energy Physics analysis carried out by members of the LHCb collaboration here at Imperial.

## The LHCb collaboration

The [LHCb collaboration](http://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/) is formed of approximately 1000 physicists from institutes all over the world, including a strong presence [here at Imperial](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/high-energy-physics/research/experiments/lhcb/). Together they contribute to the successful running of the LHCb detector and analyses the vast quantities of data it produces. The LHCb experiment is one of the 4 large experiments at the LHC particle collider operating at CERN, near Geneva. 

## Useful links - example code

- An example of some fit code can be found [here](https://github.com/mesmith75/ic-teach-kstmumu-public/blob/main/starter_notebook.ipynb).
- The data is loaded into a [`pandas.DataFrame`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html).
- Python arrays can be readily manipulated with [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/)
- To minimise the likelihood the example code uses the [`iminiuit`](https://pypi.org/project/iminuit/) package.
- Plots are made with [`matplotlib.pyplot`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html).
