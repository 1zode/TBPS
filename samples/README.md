Data samples
============

You are given various simulated data samples as Pandas dataframes, serialised with pickle. The `total_dataset.pkl` is the data to analyse. It is a representation of the real data that would come out of the LHCb detector. It will therefore contain the interesting signal decay, as well as various backgrounds. To help you understand these backgrounds simulation samples of them are provided as listed below:

* `sig.pkl` - The signal decay, simulated as per the Standard Model
* `jpsi.pkl` - <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?B^{0}\to J/\psi K^{\ast 0} " /> with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$J/\psi \rightarrow \mu\mu$ " />
